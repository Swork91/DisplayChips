== Display Chips! ==

Create a super object for potato. Then with polymorphism have other objects inherit
the potato object. From there add in other variables and functions representing the 
different ways to cook potatoes. (boil em mash em stick em in a stew.) Have each
button pressed display an image of that potato recipe. More information can be displayed
on the bottom of the screen.
